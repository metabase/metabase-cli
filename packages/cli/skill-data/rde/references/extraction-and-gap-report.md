# Extraction and gap report

Read by `extract-business-logic` only: lifting rules from code, documents, and existing definitions, and the gap report it delivers.

## Two paths

- Reuse what we have: the company wants its existing definitions mirrored, not migrated. Read each existing definition (`mb card get <id> --fields name,dataset_query --json`, and the company's tool); write every definition as a row in STATE.md's Questions table ([state.md](state.md)): home table, time column, definitional filter, breakouts. No claim tagging, no gap report. Two existing definitions of one number reconcile under `source_parity` ([reconciliation.md](reconciliation.md)) and become one.
- Migration: the rules live in code or documents the instance does not hold. Run the extraction below and stop on the gap report before any SQL.

## Extraction rules

- Write for a reader who sees only the raw tables and your document; never "see the code".
- Read from code: each literal, narrowing filter, enum with dead values, derived classification with tiebreakers, timezone and event-time versus load-time detail, join with keys, cardinality, and fan-out or row loss.
- Tag every claim `PROVEN` (read directly from code, schema, or an explicit statement), `INFERRED`, or `UNKNOWN`; cite file and line, or page and last-edited date, on every non-obvious claim.
- Date everything: file timestamp and dates in the body. Tag every rule current, deprecated, planned, or unclear; quote verbatim where a document admits a process is not followed. Never implement a planned rule as live.
- Contradictions side by side: both positions, both citations, both dates, which is newer. Record, do not resolve: prefer the source marked current or edited more recently, carried as a named constant in `cfg_<domain>` ([layering-and-naming.md](layering-and-naming.md)) with its Decisions id.
- Hardcoded-value inventory as `value | meaning | where`: thresholds, cutoffs, allowlists, denylists, retention windows, defaults on null. Preserve identifiers exactly.
- Join map: key columns, cardinality per path, explicit fan-out and drop warnings, a note wherever keys are unenforced.
- Unreachable sources: record what surrounding text says they hold, ask the user to export them, carry the gap as `UNKNOWN`.
- Crawl stop rule: open a page or file only when its title, its index entry, or a page already read names a table, a column, or a number the build needs; stop when one pass over the remaining index names none. A table or column in the database absent from the document is a defect to list.
- Documented exclusions and known incidents land as `dim_exclusion_rule` rows ([state.md](state.md)) the models left-join, so an adjusted figure sits beside the reported one; verify each documented identifier against the data first.

## The gap report

The gate between profiling and any SQL on the migration path; produce it, then stop for review.

| Verdict  | Meaning                                                                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EXACT`  | Reproducible faithfully from the source as defined                                            |
| `APPROX` | Buildable with a stated deviation: partial data, an undocumented definitional choice, a proxy |
| `NONE`   | Not buildable from this source; state what is missing                                         |

- Open with a verdict matrix, one row per metric; the headline counts verdicts from the matrix, never from memory, and is recounted whenever a row changes.
- Per metric, five fields: documented definition with citation; verified source as exact `schema.table.column` names checked to exist, with match rates; deviation or what is missing; grain, with fan-out warning and how to count; blockers as Decisions ids.
- Dimension availability is its own mandatory section: dimension, verdict, verified source, coverage; flag a dimension at a different grain than the fact, one needing an undocumented collapse map, one covering part of the population, one unsourced.
- Carry forward only contradictions and open questions touching what you must build; mark each `blocks` (cannot be exact) or `degrades` (buildable with a caveat).
- Close with the `NONE` set and what unblocks each (missing input versus missing effort), and the open decisions as choices for the reviewer.
- Verify every cited identifier against the live catalogue before shipping; the report is the deliverable.

## The specification

One document with labelled sections, never a second file:

- Rules: definitions, taxonomy, states, checks, definition of done, each non-obvious rule tagged with its provenance (profiled, user-stated, lifted from code, defaulted). Environment values live in STATE.md and are cited, never restated.
- Build notes: build order, checkpoints, validation procedure, stop conditions, citing rule sections by number. Where notes and rules disagree, the rules win.
- Declare the completeness level aimed at.
- Escape hatch for an unanticipated rule: model, body verbatim, `why`.
- A filled example specification is never a source of defaults for another business: reuse the schema, slot list, and checks, never the values.
