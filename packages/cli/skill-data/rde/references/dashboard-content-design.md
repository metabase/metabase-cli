# Dashboard content design

What a dashboard contains before it is laid out; the router sends you here at the start of any dashboard work. Layout, wiring, and chart settings: `mb skills get dashboard` and `mb skills get visualization`.

## Start from the audience's questions

Write the questions in the audience's words first; a card answering no named question does not exist. Settle:

| Setting  | Decides                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Audience | who opens it and what they already know                                                                                                                                  |
| Decision | what they do differently after looking                                                                                                                                   |
| Cadence  | daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly: the default period, the granularity, and whether the flagged incomplete period shows ([modeling-decisions.md](modeling-decisions.md)) |

Different answers across the list mean more than one dashboard: one per audience and cadence; overlapping audiences get one self-contained tab each. Match the dashboards the audience already uses (their files, or `mb dashboard get <id> --json`); defaults below apply only where nothing exists.

## Card order

1. KPI row: three to five headline numbers (a default).
2. Trend: each headline over time at the audience's cadence.
3. Breakdown: the same numbers split by the one or two dimensions this audience acts on.
4. Detail: the row-level table people export, last, only when asked for.

A card fitting no role is deleted; never a count without its denominator, a card frozen to one filter value, or a dimension nobody owns. The card name is the question as the audience asks it; grain and period go in its description: `Revenue by month (recognised, excludes current month)`, never `Revenue`. Every card composes a published metric or measure by `entity_id` with a segment and a breakout ([semantic-layer-design.md](semantic-layer-design.md)); a number the layer cannot express is a gap to log and a definition to build first, never a re-derived aggregation.

## What makes a number actionable

- Every KPI is a `smartscalar` with one comparison the audience already uses in `scalar.comparisons`: `previousPeriod` by default, `periodsAgo` with `value: 12` for seasonal cycles, `staticNumber` with `value` and `label` where a target exists (ask, never invent). A trend with a target gets `graph.show_goal: true` and `graph.goal_value`; one value against a target is `progress` with `progress.goal`.
- Every KPI has a drill: the tile's `click_behavior` links to the metric's own question, a breakdown card cross-filters the detail table, whose key column links to the source-system record when a URL pattern exists.
- A `Definitions` text card at the foot of the first tab: each headline with the first sentence of its metric description; card names are metric names.
- The one or two numbers a person must not miss get an alert to a named owner: `goal_below` or `goal_above` on the trend card carrying `graph.goal_value`, or `has_result` on an exception question returning rows only when the thing happened. Alerts and subscriptions are set in Metabase, outside this repository and the CLI, and need a configured channel: write each into the hand-back as a request to the user, and promise nothing about delivery.
- A wall or TV view is its own tab: at most six cards, no tables, no filters.

## Filters

- One filter per dimension the audience names.
- One date filter per date basis, mapped to the metric's time column on every card sharing it; a card measured on another date column sits on a tab with its own date filter, or stays unmapped and titled with its basis. Its default matches the cadence; its type matches the audience (`date/relative` for operations, `date/month-year` for monthly reviews). Where the audience switches grain, add a `temporal-unit` parameter bound to the same column.
- Every filter maps to every card it should control; a dependent pair is a linked filter and needs a metadata FK.

## Draft, then review on screen

Build the plan as a dashboard file in a `Drafts` collection (or the company's equivalent), import it, and hand back the link with the card list and the omissions, and ask for reactions to the screen, not approval of a list; stop beforehand only when audience or cadence is the user's call. A `text` virtual dashcard (`card_id: null`, `visualization_settings.virtual_card.display: "text"`) at the top states as-of date, refresh schedule, data lag, and the trust label of each headline ([collaboration-contract.md](collaboration-contract.md)): `Data through August; refreshed nightly 02:00 UTC; one day lag. MRR: Self-consistent only. Activation rate: Draft, provisional decisions: D12.` Move to the final collection after the plausibility pass.

## Delivery per audience

- Readers who do not open Metabase: a subscription on the cadence (monthly on the first, or weekly on Monday), skipped when empty for exception dashboards, filter values per recipient where audiences differ; recipients confirmed first. The user sets it up in Metabase from the hand-back.
- Readers of prose: a document file (`mb skills get document`) with the period's narrative, each headline a `cardEmbed` linked to its metric by a `smartLink` (`model: "metric"`).

## The plausibility pass

Only what `mb` can check.

- `mb card query <id> --json` returns rows for every card; a breakdown's groups sum to its headline in one `mb query` on the metric.
- `mb dashboard parameter-values <dashboard-id> <param-id>` lists values for every filter (empty means `has_field_values` or a rescan is missing); each filter tested with two values, one returning no rows.
- `mb card get <id> --fields display,visualization_settings --json` reads back chart, comparison, and goal.
- `mb dashboard cards <id> --json`: no two cards are one question under two names; the text card's as-of date matches the last job run.
- Every alert and subscription the plan names is in the hand-back as a request, with its card or dashboard, schedule, condition, and recipients.

## Finished content plan

One `date/month-year` filter on `period_month`, default last complete month, mapped to cards 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. Text card: as-of, refresh, lag, trust labels. Subscription: monthly `first`, 08:00, the CEO. Left off: ARR (MRR times twelve, said in the MRR description) and support tickets (no owner, not in the question list).
