# Layering and naming

Read before the first transform, or before writing SQL for the company's own tool.

## Discover the company's conventions first

Before proposing a layer, name, or location, inventory what exists and record it in STATE.md ([state.md](state.md)): schemas and table names ([profiling-catalog.md](profiling-catalog.md)); transforms and their collections (the files under `collections/transforms/`, and `mb transform list --fields id,name,collection_id,description --json` for what the instance holds); existing models, metrics, measures, and segments ([semantic-layer-design.md](semantic-layer-design.md)); files the user shares. Match what exists; propose a default only where nothing exists, labelled as such, as a reversible decision ([collaboration-contract.md](collaboration-contract.md)). Where a convention breaks an invariant, say so once, propose the fix, and record the answer as a Decisions row.

## Invariants and conventions

"Final layer" is the role term for the tables people read, whatever the company calls them. The loader-shape rules in [staging-rules.md](staging-rules.md) apply to whichever block first reads a raw table, even inside a wide table with no staging layer.

Invariants: every model in every layer declares the five header facts below; the block that reads a raw table never joins; nothing reads a model that a later model in the same chain refines; every rule a model carries is pinned by a transform test before it materialises ([transform-tests.md](transform-tests.md)); checks pass before the next model ([data-quality-checks.md](data-quality-checks.md)); one definition per number, computed once and read everywhere; ids kept beside labels; detail rows kept, a total beside them, never instead; re-runnable without duplicating rows; a uniqueness check on the key; business rules are the user's to decide.

Conventions, the company's: layer prefixes and name grammar; number of layers, and whether a cleaning layer exists; collection layout and output schema; transforms in Metabase or in the company's tool; a staging block materialized or a CTE.

## Layers, and the flat default

Default, to confirm, when no convention exists: staging, one block per source table (rename, cast, convert units, choose a key; no joins), owing a safe-to-read source table ([staging-rules.md](staging-rules.md)); intermediate (joins, enrichment, classification, attribution, recognition), owing each piece of shared business logic computed once; final layer (mart), the output grains people read, owing the measures for its grain on the row.

A staging block is a CTE inside its only consumer; it becomes its own materialized transform when two or more models read it or when it deduplicates a large appended sync. A final-layer table exists only if it rolls up, conforms an entity across sources, or adds measures that only make sense at the output grain; a `SELECT * FROM <model below>` is not built.

Flat under deadline: a small source, one decision maker, and a deadline get one wide table per real-world thing (`customers`, `orders`) or two layers (cleaned tables, then the tables people read), linking ids kept on every table; say so plainly. Return to layers when the same logic is about to be written into two outputs, or an output feeds another: promote the shared piece into an intermediate model.

## Naming

Default grammar `<layer>_<source>_<thing>` (`stg_acme_order`, `mart_acme_fct_order`); `<source>` is the system the data came from, not the warehouse or the team; a composite grain key is `<entity>_<period>_key`. Ambiguous words (`date`, `amount`, `status`, `type`, `value`, `count`) are banned as column names; qualify them (`order_date`, `amount_usd`). Key choice and minting: [staging-rules.md](staging-rules.md).

## Model header and constants

The transform description is the canonical header; the SQL comment at the top of the body mirrors it, and when they differ the description wins. Five facts, in the company's header style where one exists:

```sql
-- One row per: <X>
-- Key:         <column that identifies the row>
-- Sources:     <upstream models or tables>
-- Definition:  <one-line business definition>
-- Caveats:     <exclusions, constants and values, deviations, provisional decisions by id>
```

Constants live in one transform, `cfg_<domain>` (`SELECT 1 AS gap_months, 'D7' AS gap_months_note, 0.05 AS materiality, 'D2' AS materiality_note`): one row, one column per constant plus a `<constant>_note` column naming the STATE.md decision id. Every model that reads a constant cross-joins it (`CROSS JOIN analytics.cfg_billing c`, then `c.gap_months`); changing one is an edit to the `cfg_<domain>` transform file, imported; the domain's transform tests run (each declares `cfg_<domain>` as an input, so the alternative value is rehearsed on fixtures first; [transform-tests.md](transform-tests.md)), then one run of the domain's job.

## Declare grain and key before building

Agree the inventory as a table before the first model is created: staging blocks one per source table, the named intermediates, and final-layer tables as three lists (entities, events, rollups). A grain column name means the same thing everywhere; pick the date basis once, as a decision.

| Model                          | One row per        | Key                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `mart_acme_dim_customer`       | customer           | `customer_id`        |
| `mart_acme_fct_order`          | order              | `order_id`           |
| `mart_acme_fct_customer_month` | customer and month | `customer_month_key` |

A composite grain is one concatenated column, so the grain check is a duplicate count on it.

Grain ladder for rollups: one atomic grain, the finest row the source supports; one primary rollup, the grain most questions are asked at; segment rollups, the same measure set sliced one way each. Define the measure set once; pre-aggregate each child to the target grain in its own block before joining.

## Materialization

Default: full rebuild (`target.type: "table"`), so a logic change backfills every period on the next run. After the first run measure rows and duration (`mb transform runs --transform-id <id> --json`); propose incremental only where the rebuild exceeds the job window or the engine bills by scan, as a reversible decision carrying both numbers.

| Rows                                                                                             | Strategy                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Immutable events with a monotone timestamp                                                       | `table-incremental`, `append`; source checkpoint on that column                                                            |
| Entities that mutate in place                                                                    | `table-incremental`, `merge` on the declared key (deletes matching keys, then inserts); checkpoint on the update timestamp |
| Anything a whole-partition window function reads (latest-load dedup, dense spine, motion tables) | full rebuild                                                                                                               |

File shape: `target.type: table-incremental` with a `source-incremental-strategy` on the source (`mb skills get transform`, "The file"); copy the strategy's keys from an incremental transform on the instance. A run reads rows with checkpoint above the stored watermark up to the field's maximum at run start, then stores that maximum; the field must be monotone (a load timestamp, never an event time) or a late row is skipped forever. A run with no watermark is a full refresh: the first run, and the run after the checkpoint field changes. Dropping the table keeps the watermark and does not force one. A changed definition, merge key, or checkpoint column needs a full refresh, forced by changing the checkpoint field in the file. The quality gate reads the whole table after an incremental run, never the increment. History snapshots (`append` transforms): [entities-and-time.md](entities-and-time.md).

## Physical layout

Defaults to confirm: one collection per layer named for it (a collection file with `namespace: transforms` under `collections/transforms/`); transform files in its folder; every layer in one output schema separate from the landing schema; layer carried by prefix and collection, not by schema.

## Transformations that run outside Metabase

When the company transforms data in its own tool, [build-clean-tables.md](../playbooks/build-clean-tables.md) still runs: the Models table in STATE.md; SQL with the header in the company's layout and naming; slice-first validation through `q()` on physical table names; the gate on each landed table. Skipped: smoke test, collections, tag and job, transform files and `mb transform run`, `mb transform-test` (the same cases go into the tool's own test facility, [transform-tests.md](transform-tests.md)), and Library publishing of the tool's intermediate tables. The user swaps in their tool's reference syntax; hand over the files. Once the tables land: `mb db sync-schema <id> --wait`, the gate per model in dependency order (a passed table is deployed, [state.md](state.md)), then the semantic layer ([semantic-layer-design.md](semantic-layer-design.md)).
