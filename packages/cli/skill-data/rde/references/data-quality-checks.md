# Data quality checks

Read for every build that materialises a table. The checks here run on the data that landed; the rules the model applies to it are pinned first, on fixtures, by its transform tests ([transform-tests.md](transform-tests.md)). A check that fails on a case the test also covers is a fixture that did not match the source; a check that fails on a case no test covers gets that case as a fixture row before the SQL is fixed.

## The eight checks, one query per model

Substitute `<model>`, `<source>`, `<key>`, the required-column list, the cast-column list, the non-negative measure list, `<entity>`, and `<period>`; each branch is a `model|check` key and a text value; the `-- pass:` comment is the rule. Sort client-side; a trailing `ORDER BY` binds to the last branch in several dialects. Run it through `q()` ([state.md](state.md)).

```sql
SELECT '<model>|dup_key' AS k, cast(count(*) AS varchar) AS v   -- pass: 0
  FROM (SELECT <key> FROM <model> GROUP BY 1 HAVING count(*) > 1) d
UNION ALL
SELECT '<model>|null_required', cast(sum(CASE WHEN <key> IS NULL OR <required_col> IS NULL OR <required_col> = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS varchar)   -- pass: 0; keys, foreign keys, required timestamps, flags
  FROM <model>
UNION ALL
SELECT '<model>|cast_<col>', cast((SELECT count(<col>) FROM <source>) AS varchar) || '/' || cast((SELECT count(<col>) FROM <model>) AS varchar)   -- pass: equal; one branch per cast timestamp and numeric column
UNION ALL
SELECT '<model>|rows', cast(count(*) AS varchar) || '/' || cast((SELECT count(*) FROM <source>) AS varchar)   -- pass: equal, or the delta is a filter declared in the header; per source block on a joined model
  FROM <model>
UNION ALL
SELECT '<model>|grain', CASE WHEN count(*) = count(DISTINCT <key>) THEN 'true' ELSE 'false' END   -- pass: true; a composite grain is one materialised key column
  FROM <model>
UNION ALL
SELECT '<model>|non_negative_<amount>', CASE WHEN min(<amount>) >= 0 THEN 'true' ELSE 'false' END   -- pass: true; one branch per measure that cannot go below zero
  FROM <model>
UNION ALL
SELECT '<model>|period_flag', cast(count(*) AS varchar)   -- pass: 0; on the model that derives periods; a table with no entity groups by a constant
  FROM (SELECT <entity> FROM <model> GROUP BY 1
        HAVING sum(CASE WHEN is_complete_period THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) <> 1
            OR max(CASE WHEN is_complete_period THEN <period> END) > max(CASE WHEN NOT is_complete_period THEN <period> END)) p
UNION ALL
SELECT '<model>|enum_<mapped_col>', cast(sum(CASE WHEN <code_col> IS NOT NULL AND <mapped_col> IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS varchar)   -- pass: 0; one branch per CASE over source values
  FROM <model>
```

A failed enum branch is a decision on the mapping, never a `coalesce`; make mappings total by construction (normalise, then bucket).

## Report shape and blocking rule

```
DQ: stg_acme_customer (slice: created_at >= 2026-08-01)
  OK    rows 10000/10000
  FAIL  cast_created_at 10000/9880
```

- Any `FAIL` blocks the next model: stop per [collaboration-contract.md](collaboration-contract.md) with the failing check, its value, and two or three sample rows. Never lower a threshold, widen a cast, or add a `coalesce` to turn a `FAIL` green.
- Join match rate is checked before a join is built, with the foreign-key probe in [profiling-catalog.md](profiling-catalog.md): matched and unmatched per candidate path; the floor is 98 percent matched, a default to confirm; below it is a `[CHECKPOINT]` with the unmatched count, share, and up to five sample rows.
- Results per model go in STATE.md's Checks table ([state.md](state.md)) at deploy.

## Cadence

- Slice first: prove the logic on a bounded predicate (a recent window or one entity) held in a comment-marked line of the model SQL; iterate until the shape and the eight checks pass on the slice; then remove the predicate, materialise, and run the eight on the whole table once.
- Staging: one query per layer, every model's branches in one block, after the layer lands. Intermediate and above: per model, before the next model starts.
- An incremental target is checked on the whole table after every run, never on the increment alone ([layering-and-naming.md](layering-and-naming.md)).

## Semantic checks structural checks cannot replace

Report these as their own block. The first four are also transform-test expectations on a fixture built for them (one document per class, one row past each bound); the last three need real data.

## Checks that outlive the build

Per layer, save the structural checks as one native card file in the data-quality collection that returns rows only on failure, and ask its owner to attach an alert in Metabase that fires on any row, on the job's cadence. Hand back the card and the alert request with the tables; fuller controls: [reconciliation.md](reconciliation.md).

The card: the `dup_key`, `null_required`, `non_negative`, and `period_flag` branches of every model in the layer as integer counts, plus freshness per driving table, wrapped so only failures return:

```sql
SELECT k, n FROM (
  SELECT '<model>|dup_key' AS k, count(*) AS n FROM (SELECT <key> FROM <model> GROUP BY 1 HAVING count(*) > 1) d
  UNION ALL
  SELECT '<model>|freshness', CASE WHEN current_date - cast(max(<loaded_at>) AS date) > <cadence_days> THEN 1 ELSE 0 END FROM <model>
  UNION ALL ...
) c WHERE n > 0
```

The alert is set in Metabase, not in this repository: name the card, the send condition (`has_result`, any row), the schedule (after the job's run, in the instance's report timezone), and the owner in the hand-back for the user to create.
