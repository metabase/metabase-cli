# Transform tests

Read before the first model that carries a rule, and before changing a deployed one. When the instance refuses `mb transform-test`, the fallback is at the end.

## What a test is, and what it is for

A transform test runs the transform against fixtures instead of its real sources: one input per table the transform reads, the transform run into a temp table, each expectation checked against that output, the temp tables dropped. Nothing reads or writes a real table, the transform need not have run, and a test takes seconds. Query transforms only (native SQL or MBQL); a Python transform has no test.

The gate ([data-quality-checks.md](data-quality-checks.md)) checks the data that landed: shape, parity, grain, on the rows that exist today. A test checks the logic: it pins a rule on rows chosen to exercise it, including cases the data does not hold yet (a customer whose gap is exactly the threshold, a refund line, a placeholder string in a lossy cast), and it fails the moment a patch or a constant changes the behaviour. The gate runs on every model, tests on every model that carries a rule; neither replaces the other, and neither replaces reconciliation ([reconciliation.md](reconciliation.md)).

## What to test

One test per model that carries a rule; one expectation per rule. The rules to pin are the ones the header's Definition and Caveats name, plus every `[DECIDED, reversible]` recorded for the model: the decision's alternative is what a future patch will try, and the expectation is what tells the user the number moved because the rule did.

| Rule                                                            | Fixture rows                                                                                 | Expectation                                                                              |

| Attribute ladder                                                | one row per rung, one that falls through to the default                                      | `equals` on the key, the attribute, and `<attribute>_source`                             |

| Dedup, unit or epoch conversion, placeholder nulls in staging   | one duplicate group, a minor-unit amount, an epoch, a `"N/A"`, a lossy text value            | `equals` on the source column beside the cast                                            |

A staging block that neither deduplicates nor converts has nothing to test; a wide table tests each rule it inlines. The domain file STATE.md names carries the cases its rules need. A fixture is small enough to read at a glance: one case per row, ids numbered in case order, the case list in the test's `description`. A fixture of hundreds of copied production rows is a second gate, not a test, and carries personal data into the test body ([collaboration-contract.md](collaboration-contract.md)).

## Fixture rules

- Inputs cover exactly the tables the transform reads: one for every source, none for a table it never reads; the run refuses a missing input and an unused one. A model that cross-joins `cfg_<domain>` declares it as an input, so the constant under test is visible in the test, and a second test runs the same model under the alternative value.
- `format: "rows"` by default: `columns` with the warehouse's own type names in `database_type` (a `CAST` target: `INTEGER`, `NUMERIC(12,2)`, `TIMESTAMP`, `VARCHAR(255)`), `rows` as objects, `null` where the source is null. `format: "sql"` builds a fixture a literal list would bloat: a calendar spine, a series of periods.
- The transform's SQL runs unchanged against the fixture, so every column it reads exists in the input with a type that casts and compares as the real column does; read the real types from `mb table get <id> --include fields`.
- Fixture dates sit at fixed points relative to the `last_complete_period` in the `cfg_<domain>` input, never relative to today, so the test does not rot; a rule that reads `current_date` (a freshness check) is exercised on rows the clock cannot reach or left to the gate.
- In the model's SQL, alias every source table and qualify columns by the alias (`FROM raw_billing.invoice i ... i.amount`), never by the table name: the rewrite to temp tables leaves a table-name qualifier dangling and the run refuses it. Same in expectation SQL.

## Expectations

- `equals`: the output holds exactly the declared rows over exactly the declared columns, as a multiset, order ignored. Columns not named are not compared, so name the key and the columns the rule decides; leave load timestamps out. `format: "rows"` with `columns` and `rows`, or `format: "sql"` when the expected rows are easier to state as a query over the inputs (the source sum per document, say).
- `empty`: a query that must return no rows, over the output named as the transform's target (`<out_schema>.<model>`; the run redirects it) or over a declared input, never a real table. The gate's `dup_key`, `null_required`, and `non_negative` branches wrapped so only violations return, or a rule stated as its violation: `SELECT * FROM analytics.mart_billing_fct_customer_month m WHERE m.state = 'churned' AND m.prior_mrr_usd = 0`.
- Names are unique within a test and name the rule, not the mechanism: `gap of exactly 1 month is retained`, `annual invoice spreads into 12 equal rows`.

```

The body is closed: `transform_id` (the numeric id, `mb eid --model transform <entity_id>` after the import), `name`, `description`, `inputs`, `expectations`, nothing else; `update` replaces `inputs` and `expectations` whole. Tests have no file form; keep each body in `./.scratch/<m>.test.json` and name it in STATE.md so the next change edits the same body. Commands and the run report keys: `mb skills get transform`, "Transform tests".

## Cadence

- Write the tests after the transform's first import and before its first `transform run --sync`; a red expectation is fixed in the transform file, imported, re-run; the model materialises only on green. Record the count and the result in the Models row `tests` column ([state.md](state.md)).
- After every source change, the model's tests run before its gate. After a change to `cfg_<domain>`, every test in the domain's job runs (`mb transform-test list --transform-id <id>` per Models row).
- Changing a deployed model starts by running its tests as they stand. A new case: add the expectation, see it fail, fix, see it pass. A changed rule: the expectation's old and new rows are the change, shown in the hand-back and updated in the same step, never deleted. A test that has to be deleted for a change to pass is a `[CHECKPOINT]`.
- Tests live on the instance, not on the branch, so the hand-back names each test and its body file; the reviewer who imports the tracked branch recreates them there and runs them first. A red test never materialises.

## Reading a failure

`run` exits non-zero and `--json` says what each expectation found. A failed `equals`: `missing-rows` the rule did not produce, `extra-rows` it should not have, `cell-mismatches` per column when exactly one row differs on each side; a failed `empty`: `sample` holds the violating rows. `error` on one expectation is that expectation's own SQL failing; the others still report. A refusal names an authoring error: an input missing or unused, a column the output lacks, a table-name qualifier that survived the rewrite. A `422` is the transform itself failing on the fixture: fix the SQL, not the test. A fixture is edited only when it was wrong, and the hand-back says which; an expectation is never loosened to pass.

## When the instance refuses tests, or outside Metabase

When `mb transform-test` refuses with a capability error, record `tests: unavailable` in STATE.md and prove each rule once through `q()`: the fixture as a `VALUES` CTE in place of the source in a copy of the model SQL, the expectation as a query over it, the result in the Models row `note`, the SQL kept in `./.scratch/<m>.test.sql` so it becomes the test once the instance runs them. When transforms run in the company's own tool, the same cases go into that tool's test facility ([layering-and-naming.md](layering-and-naming.md), transformations that run outside Metabase).
