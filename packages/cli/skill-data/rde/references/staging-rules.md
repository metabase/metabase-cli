# Staging rules

Read when starting the cleaning layer, whatever the company calls it, and for whichever model first reads a raw table ([layering-and-naming.md](layering-and-naming.md)).

## Invariants

- The block that reads a raw table never joins; enrichment, decoding against a lookup, and classification belong to an intermediate model or a later CTE in a wide model.
- No business logic: no recognition rule, status collapse, or derived category. Casts, renames, unit conversion, decoding, key selection, and loader bookkeeping removal only.
- No filter that changes the population the table describes. A hygiene filter removing structurally broken rows is allowed and declared in the header.
- No aggregation: staged rows equal source rows minus the tombstones and duplicates removed deliberately and reported.

## Defaults to match or confirm

- One staging block per source table, named by the company's convention; a CTE inside its only consumer, materialized as its own transform only when shared or deduplicating a large appended sync ([layering-and-naming.md](layering-and-naming.md)). Never merge two source tables into one block, never split one into two, never conform two sources into one shape here (intermediate work). An inlined block is still headed and still gated, with row parity per source block.
- Money in one unit and timestamps in one timezone, each converted exactly once, at this step, with the unit in the column name and the timezone in the header.
- Deduplication sits here only when measured as needed (below).

## How a loader shapes a table

Discover the loader's shape from the landed tables: read the column list per table (`mb table get <id> --include fields --json`); a flattened column exists only where a parent row populated it, so two tables of one source type can carry different columns.

| Columns present on most tables                                            | Implies                                                                                                                     |

| Row id, load id, parent id, list index                                    | Nested fields flattened into prefixed columns; arrays split into child tables linked by parent id; load ids order the loads |
| Sync timestamp, soft-delete flag, deleted-at, or change-capture operation | Rows re-delivered each sync; deletes are a flag or a change row; dedup by key on the sync column                            |
| None                                                                      | Hand-loaded or a database replica; freshness and dedup behaviour unknown until measured                                     |

Record the freshness column and its maximum value; a stale loader caps every trailing period in every model ([modeling-decisions.md](modeling-decisions.md)).

Count the distinct currencies or units before suffixing a column with one.

## Preserve the source column beside a lossy cast

When a cast can lose information (text to number, text to date, wide numeric to narrow), cast into a new column and keep the original beside it, so cast parity compares non-null originals against non-null casts.

Never gain nulls silently: more nulls in a staged column than in the source is a failure to investigate.

## Key selection

- Globally unique, stable source ids are the primary and foreign keys. Do not mint replacements.
- Mint a key only for a child or array table with no natural key (loader table above).
- One candidate: proceed. Several candidates: a reversible decision, shown with the evidence ([collaboration-contract.md](collaboration-contract.md)).
- Assert uniqueness on the chosen key with the key-uniqueness probe in [profiling-catalog.md](profiling-catalog.md). Duplicates mean the wrong key or a table needing deduplication.

## Decode and normalize encodings

Normalized sources hide meaning in lookup tables (`*_field`, `*_choice`, `*_question`, `*_type`). Build the code-to-label map from the lookup and read the label from it in the query, never as a typed literal. The join makes that model intermediate; staging delivers the code column typed and named.

Never flatten a multi-valued field into an opaque blob (`"email | phone | text"`): separate columns or a child table with one row per value, the user's choice.

## Measure whether deduplication is needed

Run the key-uniqueness probe ([profiling-catalog.md](profiling-catalog.md)) on every staging model and compare source rows to staged rows. Some loaders land exactly one row per key; a loader that appends every sync leaves one row per key per load and inflates a table by a multiple. Zero duplicates proves a plain one-row-per-source-row model correct.

When loads append and the rule is "latest load wins", the standard-SQL shape is:

```sql
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT s.*, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY <key> ORDER BY <load id or sync timestamp> DESC) AS load_rank
  FROM <source table> s
)
SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE load_rank = 1;
```
